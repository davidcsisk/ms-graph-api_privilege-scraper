>>> Could you provide an extended description of this graph api scope claim?  My focus is on the privilege level the permission contains. EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.A
... ll

The `EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All` permission in Azure AD Graph API allows an application to read and write all entitlement management information within the
organization, including roles, requests, and assignments. This includes the ability to create, update, and delete roles, requests, and assignments. Additionally, this
permission also allows the application to read all other attributes of users, groups, and applications in the organization's directory.

This scope claim is considered high-privileged because it allows an application to make changes to entitlement management information within the organization. It is
important to carefully restrict access to this scope claim to only those applications that require it, as granting it to unauthorized applications could potentially
lead to data breaches or other security incidents.

>>> Could you provide a privilege score estimate that is between 1 and 20 for this permission? A higher score means that it carries more privilege and could do more damage
... if misused.

The `EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All` permission in Azure AD Graph API has a privilege score of 18 out of 20. This is based on the fact that it allows an
application to make changes to entitlement management information within the organization, which could potentially lead to data breaches or other security incidents
if not used responsibly. A higher score indicates that this permission carries more privilege and is associated with a greater risk of misuse.

>>> Excellent.  Can you return the scope claim name, this privilege score, and the extended description as csv formatted data?
